# Project 1 _Get Dancing_

 Coming into this class I had no idea what to expect, I read a little of the main textbook and figured, "okay great, the mechanics of the ear and how sound travels; pile on some tech and I'm set." Well that didn't go as planned and I learned really quick that this was going to be both fun and torturous. Going into with an open mind this is my first project.

 Initially I opened up logic and it looked fairly similar to the program I work from at home, though admittedly logic looks far nicer with a darker layout. That unfortunately is where the similarities end. After dropping head first into the lesson I got to the library and sampled the beats, the library of logic is very intuitive and I found it fun to navigate the various instrument sections.

  #### Skyline Piano is probably my favorite if i'm honest
  
  The project itself was actually pretty fun and easy once I got used to the interface and a mac in general, there were few hiccups until the mixing stage of the project. The plug-ins, while they looked and acted similar to the actual instruments took some getting used to.

 The mixer was pretty cut and dry after getting used to audio plug-ins, tweak the gains here, increase audio volume there, and boom [instant mp3.](/audio/p1.mp3)
 
 Finally a word to the wise, always make sure the cycle button is on screen, you'll need it. Sometimes the icon isn't displayed, making it incredibly annoying to enable or disable looping, in my case even to menu links didn't work, finally after finding it in advanced options and enabling it the illustrious cycle button appeared.
