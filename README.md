# Project 1 _Get Dancing_

 Coming into this class I had no idea what to expect, I read a little of the main textbook and figured, "okay great, the mechanics of the ear and how sound travels; pile on some tech and I'm set." Well that didn't go as planned and I learned really quick that this was going to be both fun and torturous.

 Initially I opened up logic and it looked fairly similar to the program I work from at home, though admittedly logic looks far nicer with a darker layout. That unfortunately is where the similarities end. After dropping head first into the lesson I got to the library and sampled the beats, the library of logic is very intuitive and I found it fun to navigate the various instrument sections.

  #### Skyline Piano is probably my favorite if i'm honest
  
  The project itself was actually pretty fun and easy once I got used to the interface and a mac in general, there were few hiccups until the mixing stage of the project. The plug-ins, while they looked and acted similar to the actual instruments took some getting used to.

 The mixer was pretty cut and dry after getting used to audio plug-ins, tweak the gains here, increase audio volume there, and boom instant mp3.

 Finally a word to the wise, always make sure the cycle button is on screen, you'll need it.
